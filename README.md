# Discrete City: A Procedural World Project

This project is created for the [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) Procedural World challenge.

Here is the online version: https://discrete-city.netlify.app/

It is a fantasy city, inspired by the idea of discrete space and time, works of Stephen Wolfram, and capsule architecture of Nakagin Tower in Tokyo.

The world's generation is driven by a 3D Neural Cellular Automaton - a 3D cellular automaton controlled by a pre-trained neural network.

Built with Threlte, SvelteKit, Three.js, and Brain.js. Modelled with Blender. Textures made with Midjourney.
